the request flow is simple:

request goes to express server

then when we use the trpc express middleware in server.ts, the middleware forwareds the request to a certain api endpoint that lives in next.js land

Express --> Next.js

how do we listen to the reqs in next.js? using the route-handler (nothing more than an api endpoint in next js that listens to reqs coming from express)

the route of course is defined in the app folder:
api/trpc/[trpc] (dynamic route)
